# Resume Website with Nginx and Apache2
<h1>Host a personal webpage on AWS</h1>

<h4>Description</h4>

This project outlines the steps to deploy a personal profile webpage on an AWS EC2 instance, showcasing essential cloud and web hosting skills. It begins with creating a secure bastion EC2 instance, configuring security groups for SSH and HTTP access, and installing a web server (Nginx for static content or Apache2 for dynamic content). The default web page is replaced with a custom HTML profile file, followed by modifying inbound rules to enable public HTTP access. The roadmap also includes associating an Elastic IP for consistent access, running the web server, and creating an AMI for disaster recovery, ensuring both high availability and resilience of the deployed solution.
